# Kerala Traffic Management System - Railway Deployment Ready 🚀

## Project Overview
Clean, optimized Kerala traffic monitoring system ready for Railway platform deployment.

## What's Included ✅
- **Demo App**: `demo/app_simple_kerala.py` - Kerala traffic monitoring interface
- **Dashboard**: `frontend/app_unified_improved.py` - Professional traffic dashboard  
- **Web Proxy**: `website/` - Nginx configuration for routing
- **Docker Setup**: `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-service container setup
- **Railway Config**: `Procfile` & `start.sh` - Railway deployment scripts

## What Was Removed 🧹
- ❌ Old ML models (`analysis/` folder - ~15MB)
- ❌ SUMO simulation files (`simulation/`, `sumo_network/`)  
- ❌ Backend processing (`backend/` folder)
- ❌ Old data files (`data/delhi/`, Bangalore datasets)
- ❌ Documentation (`docs/` folder)
- ❌ GitHub workflows (`.github/` folder)
- ❌ Unused dependencies (pygame, neat-python, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Railway Deployment
1. **Main Service**: Runs Kerala demo on Railway's PORT
2. **Lightweight**: Only 3 core dependencies (streamlit, pandas, plotly)
3. **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design for all screen sizes
4. **Production Ready**: Clean codebase, no unused files
